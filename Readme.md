ack-mode.el
===========

Emacs mode for browsing a source tree using
[ack](http://betterthangrep.com/)'s output.

The ack-mode search results buffer is on the right in the screenshot.
It shows the results in the same fashion as `ack` - grouped by file.
You can navigate between files with `tab` and `shift tab`.  The buffer
on the left was brought in by hitting `return` on a line in the
results buffer.
